			  <li><span>You got only 6 hours of sleep last night.  Believe it or not, 
sleep DOES effect weight loss.  Studies have shown that 
people who don't get 7-8 hours of sleep a night gain more 
weight.  Even though you may have a busy schedule, try 
to make a plan to get at least 7 hours tonight. </span></li>
			  <li><span>Your portion of Fast Carb at Lunch was large.  You had 
both Hamburger Bun and French Fries at lunch and that 
means your Fast Carb portion was larger than a Fat Loss 
Plate.  It's important to have the right proportions of foods 
at each meal, to keep your glycemic level in check.  That 
keeps you in in the Fat Burning Zone.  Check the link Fat 
Loss Plate At-A-Glance to see the best proportions for 
weight loss.</span></li>
			   <li class="last-pra"><span> You had 5 Red Wine last night.  Since you're currently doing 
the 21 Day Metabolism Makeover, we recommend avoiding 
alcohol all together, while your body is "resetting" your 
metabolism.  That's because alcohol can have a dramatic 
effect on your glycemic level, and send you quickly into Fat 
Storing Zone.  But you don't have to give it up forever.  
Once you finish with these 21 days, Food Lovers For Life 
will show you how to work alcohol back into your eating 
program in a way that it won't spike your glycemic level, 
and will allow you keep burning fat all day long.</span></li>
